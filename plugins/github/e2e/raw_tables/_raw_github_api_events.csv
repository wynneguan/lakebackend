the bug**\r\nWhen the `Pool.Release()` function is called, it can leave the `purgePeriodically` function running until its heartbeat `time.Ticker` triggers, at which point the condition on whether the pool is closed is checked by the `purgePeriodically` for loop. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that one cannot assume the goroutines associated with an ant pool are completely cleaned up until the `purgePeriodically` function is completed - and as such, tools like goleak (https://github.com/uber-go/goleak) will report a leaked goroutine in tests. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce

Please describe how these code changes achieve your intention.\r\n<!-- Please be specific. Motivate the problem, and justify why this is the best solution. -->\r\n\r\nWhile reading through the library it became clear to me that `PoolWithFunc` was just a specific case of `Pool`, where instead of submitting tasks, the caller simply passes arguments for a pre-defined function to be run on the workers. This means that, instead of a `chan func() interface{}` as the message queue, we use a `chan interface{}`, and IMO this shouldn't warrant a completely different `Pool` implementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the complete removal of the `worker_func.go` file, choosing instead to adapt `PoolWithFunc` to use the default `Pool`, changing `.Invoke` to simply call the underlying `Pool.Submit` method with an anonymous function wrapping `p.poolFunc(args)`, transforming it into a `goWorker` accepted task, giving us a more robust and simpler library.\r\n\r\n## 3. Please link to the relevant issues (if any).\r\n<!-- This adds crucial context to your change. -->\r\n\r\n## 4.

Please describe how these code changes achieve your intention.\r\n<!-- Please be specific. Motivate the problem, and justify why this is the best solution. -->\r\n\r\nWhile reading through the library it became clear to me that `PoolWithFunc` was just a specific case of `Pool`, where instead of submitting tasks, the caller simply passes arguments for a pre-defined function to be run on the workers. This means that, instead of a `chan func() interface{}` as the message queue, we use a `chan interface{}`, and IMO this shouldn't warrant a completely different `Pool` implementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the complete removal of the `worker_func.go` file, choosing instead to adapt `PoolWithFunc` to use the default `Pool`, changing `.Invoke` to simply call the underlying `Pool.Submit` method with an anonymous function wrapping `p.poolFunc(args)`, transforming it into a `goWorker` accepted task, giving us a more robust and simpler library.\r\n\r\n## 3.

Please fill this out to help us make the most of your pull request.\r\n\r\nWas this change discussed in an issue first? That can help save time in case the change is not a good fit for the project. Not all pull requests get merged.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for pull requests to go through several, iterative reviews. Please be patient with us! Every reviewer is a volunteer, and each has their own style.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 1. Are you opening this pull request for bug-fixs, optimizations or new feature?\r\noptimizations \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Please describe how these code changes achieve your intention.\r\nI found that loop_queue had an intention to use binarysearch method, just like worker_stack. But it's removed before being merged into the master branch due to some bugs.  I mapped true positions to imaginary positions before using binarysearch method and also add some tests to make sure it works.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3.
